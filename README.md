# Hello-World


Hello computer world,

  Understanding that computers use a sequence of numbers to interpret a humans imagination, i would say that coding kinda makes us artists. This may or may not be true; truth however is convoluted and is all based off the perception of the human brain. Therefore, as long as a person is sincere with their thoughts then the truth may not be a lie; however it may be interpreted as such. With all this being said; I am right about about coding being a paintbrush and a screen being our canvas.
